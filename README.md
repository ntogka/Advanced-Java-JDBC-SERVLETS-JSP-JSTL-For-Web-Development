STORAGE AREAS



As part of the Enterprise Application development it is essential to manage the organizations

data like Employee Details, Customer Details, Products Details..etc

To manage the above specified data in enterprise applications we have to use storage areas

(Memory elements). There are two types of Storage areas.



1) TEMPORARY STORAGE AREAS:

These are the memory elements, which will store the data temporarily

Eg: Buffers, Java Objects



2) PERMANENT STORAGE OBJECTS:

These are the memory elements which will store data permanently.

Eg: FileSystems, DBMS, DataWareHouses.



File Systems:

It is a System, it will be provided by the local operating System.

Due to the above reason File Systems are not suitable for platform independent

technologies

like JAVA.

File Systems are able to store less volume of the data.

File Systems are able to provide less security.

File Systems may increases data Redundancy.

In case of File Systems Query Language support is not available. So that all the database

operations are complex.



DBMS:

Database Management System is very good compare to file System but still it able to store less data



when compared to DataWareHouses.

DBMS is very good at the time of storing the data but which is not having Fast Retrieval

Mechanisms
